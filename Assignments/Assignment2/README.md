# Assignment 2

## JavaScript DOM

1. Make a webpage as shown in the Image.
2. There should be a Search Box where we can search any product.
3. Make category buttons, which on clicking will show user only a single category products. (For e.g. in this image if someone clicks CAKES then only products of CAKE category will show)


You don't need to make your webpage exactly same, it just need to have above three functionalities (at least. You can add more if you want). Use your own creativity. Happy Coding ðŸŽˆ.
