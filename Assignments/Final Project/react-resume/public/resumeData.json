    "bio":"I am a Software Engineer. I have good command in Java, Python, and C/C++. I have used the SQLite database, Oops concepts, and file handling in my projects.\n I had built a basic mathematical mobile calculator using Java and XML. I have made a project named \"CGPA calculator\" where Python Tkinter library was used to build the UI and the SQLite database was used and CRUD operations of RDMS were used.\n I also have basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Using these I have also made a website as a part of academic assignment. I have also undergone two certifications on Python language provided by Google and Internshala and one in android development from Internshala.",
